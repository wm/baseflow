  @moduledoc """
  Using a GenStage for implementing a GenEvent manager
  replacement where each handler runs as a separate process.
  It is around 40 LOC without docs and comments.

  This implementation will keep events in an internal queue
  until there is demand, leading to client timeouts for slow
  consumers. Alternative implementations could rely on the
  GenStage internal buffer, although such implies events will
  be lost if the buffer gets full (see GenStage docs).

  Generally, the GenStage implementation gives developers
  more control to handle buffers and apply back-pressure while
  leveraging concurrency and synchronization mechanisms.
